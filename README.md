# Grasshopper

## Purpose
To create a game-like environment that allows students to collaboratively
experience and learn about a fictional reality together, gaining insights
and meta-cognitive skills that can be applied to real life.

## Gameplay

### Commerce
Students will be able to trade with one another. The world should foster
an economy that can be developed organically.
#### Currency
Will there be a set currency, or should the world be set up to allow one
to arise?
#### Trade
While being able to trade items for items, students should also be able to
trade items for work. Maybe there can be tasks within the environment that,
while any one can do, only some will be adept at.

### Code
Everything within the world we be defined by an underlying source code
relatable to DNA or the more fundamental forces of electromagnetism and gravity.
The source code will be accessible and modifiable, but largely unintelligble.
Students will need to analyze and experiment with the code to be able to
modify it in desired ways. A deep understanding of the workings of the code
could lead to effects that could seem almost magical. Imagine being able to
modify how gravity affects things, or building a device that can transport
matter.
